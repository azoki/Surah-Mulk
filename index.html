</a>
<p style="font-size:23pt;color:darkblue;text-align:center ">Surah Al-Mulk is the 67th chapter of the Quran, and there are various hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) that emphasize the benefits of reciting and reflecting upon this surah. While it's important to note that the spiritual and personal benefits can vary from person to person, some common benefits mentioned in hadith literature include:<br>
1-Protection from the Punishment of the Grave:
Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Surah Al-Mulk protects from the torment of the grave." (Sahihul Jamiea 1/680, Hakim 2/498 & Nasai)<br>
2-Intercession on the Day of Judgment:
The surah is said to intercede for its reciter on the Day of Judgment. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "There is a Surah in the Qur'an which contains thirty Ayat which kept interceding for a man until his sins are forgiven. This Surah is 'Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion.' (Surah Al-Mulk 67)." (Tirmidhi)<br>
